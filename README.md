# Parser_MiniLang

Presents the design, implementation, and testing of a parser for a simple
expression and statement grammar. The parser is implemented in Python as a top- down recursive descent parser. The purpose of this parser is to analyze input
programs written in the defined grammar and produce a structured representation of the program's syntax
